## 🎯 The Problem
 
Job hunting on LinkedIn is a full-time job in itself. New listings appear daily, most are irrelevant, and by the time you spot a good one, 200 people have already applied.
 
**SnapplAI flips the game:** it runs on a schedule, scrapes fresh listings, lets AI read and score every single one against *your* CV, and emails you only the top matches — before the crowd even sees them.
 
---
 
## ⚙️ How It Works
 
The pipeline runs in 4 sequential steps, fully automated:
 
**1. Scrape** → `job_scraper()` pulls fresh listings from LinkedIn based on your search settings (role, location, filters) using python-jobspy.
 
**2. Summarize** → `agentic_summarize()` sends each job description to Gemini, which extracts structured fields (title, seniority, skills, salary, etc.) as clean JSON.
 
**3. Analyze** → `agentic_analyze()` reads your CV and scores each listing on how well it matches your profile. Chain-of-thought enforced: the model writes `analysis` before `score` in the JSON schema, so reasoning comes before judgment.
 
**4. Deliver** → `send_email()` builds an email with the top-scored jobs and sends it to your inbox via SMTP.

**5. Apply and analytics** → Two attachments complete the report: top match, a filtered Excel with all scraped jobs, and an analytics .txt summarizing the batch.

--

**Resilience:** each Gemini call retries with exponential backoff on transient errors (`429`/`500`/`503`) and falls back through a fixed chain (`gemini-3.5-flash-lite` → `gemini-3.1-flash-lite`), so a temporarily overloaded model no longer crashes the whole pipeline.
 
**Key principle:** AI reads and evaluates. Python orchestrates and delivers. No frameworks, no agents-calling-agents — just a clean data pipeline with LLM calls where they matter.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
 
| Component | Technology |
|-----------|-----------|
| LLM | Google GenAI SDK — `gemini-3.5-flash-lite` (primary), `gemini-3.1-flash-lite` (fallback) |
| Resilience | Retry with exponential backoff + fixed model fallback chain (`src/llm.py`) |
| Scraping | python-jobspy (LinkedIn) |
| Data | pandas, PyPDF / PyMuPDF |
| Parsing | BeautifulSoup4 |
| Email | smtplib (SMTP) — provider-agnostic (Gmail, Outlook/Office365, ...) |
| Config | python-dotenv |

## 🏗️ Pipeline Architecture
 
![Pipeline Architecture](assets/architecture.png)
 
The entire pipeline operates on a single pandas DataFrame that gets enriched at each step. No intermediate files, no database — everything flows through memory.
 
---
 
## 📊 AI Output Fields
 
![Pipeline Architecture](assets/output.png)

Each job in the email is ranked by fit score and includes:

- city, company, role, and work mode
- a one-line AI summary explaining the match
- a direct apply link to the LinkedIn listing

Two attachments complete the report: a filtered Excel with all scraped jobs, and an analytics .txt summarizing the batch.

## 🚀 Setup
 
1. Get a free API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
2. Generate an app password for your email (e.g. [Gmail App Password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)). For non-Gmail providers, set `SMTP_HOST`/`SMTP_PORT` in `.env` — e.g. Outlook/Office365 uses `smtp.office365.com` on port `587` (STARTTLS); Gmail defaults to `smtp.gmail.com` on `465` (SSL).
3. Place your CV (PDF) in `your_cv_config/`
4. Configure search settings: use `file_config.txt` to create your `file_config.env` ([filter docs](https://github.com/Bunsly/JobSpy))
5. Create your `.env` from the template: `cp example_env.txt .env`
### Deploy
 
#### Local
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TDK-99/SnapplAI.git && cd SnapplAI
pip install -r requirements.txt
# complete setup steps above
python main.py
```
 
#### Docker
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TDK-99/SnapplAI.git && cd SnapplAI
# complete setup steps above
docker build -t snapplai .
docker run --env-file .env snapplai
```
 
#### GitHub Actions
1. Fork this repo (or [create a private copy](#private-copy))
2. Complete setup steps 1-4 above in your fork
3. Edit your settings in `.github/workflows/snapplai.yml` under the `env:` block
4. Add credentials as **repository secrets** (Settings → Secrets → Actions): `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `GMAIL_USER`, `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD`
5. **Actions** tab → enable workflows → **Run workflow**

## 🛣️ Roadmap v2
 
- ✅**Multi-country scraping** — search across 2+ countries in a single run (custom feature, not supported by python-jobspy out of the box)
- **Excel/DB deduplication** — persistent storage to compare runs and filter out already-seen listings, so you never score the same job twice
- **Scoring calibration** — benchmark AI scores against known good/bad matches to improve match quality
- **Output redesign** — better visual formatting for the email report (job cards, readability, direct links)
- **Fix issue** — fix main issue: fallback model, smtp for non @gmail user and github action new user
